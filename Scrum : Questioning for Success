In my journey as a Scrum Master, I've discovered the transformative power of asking the right questions to enhance our team's performance. 
Much like in my role in the SQL database project, where I achieved an 85% reduction in critical alerts, asking powerful questions proved 
instrumental in streamlining processes.
Picture this scenario: just as we faced an avalanche of email alerts overwhelming our team's inboxes, DBA teams can become inundated with
too many tasks, hindering their ability to complete any efficiently. The stress mounts as SLA deadlines are to be met, mirroring the urgency
I encountered in resolving alert issues.
To address these issues effectively, I adopted the best practice of Scrum by asking powerful questions during our Daily Scrum meetings. 
These questions, though crucial, are often sidestepped because they might lead to uncomfortable answers.
Drawing from my experience in SQL database management, here are relevant questions I asked:

How we needed to ensure alerts were relevant to our database management goals?
What obstacles hinder alert reduction, and where do we need help?
What is the most significant set of alerts in our current reporting, and how can we address them today?
If you were a stakeholder invested in our project, what would you prioritize to ensuring our database alerts are aligned with client needs?
Where can we offer assistance to team members in attending to their alerts by emphasizing upon proactive communication?
If we do not attend to alerts, how would it impact availability of database servers?

Just as my team began adopting these questions and fostering a culture of inquiry, Scrum teams too gradually embraced this practice. 
Asking powerful questions, as I learned in my role, isn't about making things complicated. It's about creating a welcoming and collaborative
environment where team members can openly discuss challenges and find solutions together. And if team members ever feel uneasy about asking questions,
as I did initially, they can establish a signal for when they're open to such inquiries, just as I did with my DBA support team during alert resolutions.

In summary, my experience as Project Manager in SQL database management taught me the importance of asking powerful questions, a skill that significantly
contributed to our team's success. By paralleling these experiences, I hope to encourage others to explore this approach in their Scrum endeavors, fostering
growth and collaboration.
